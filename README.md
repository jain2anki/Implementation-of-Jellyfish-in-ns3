# Implementation-of-Jellyfish-in-ns3

**What is Jellyfish Topology in Networks?**


Jellyfish, an incrementally-expandable, high-bandwidth data center networking topology based on randomness.
Basically, itâ€™s an unstructured network that utilizes a randomized topology for interconnection in a data center, unlike, for example a fat tree topology that utilizes hierarchies. It allows for construction of arbitrary-size networks that can be easily incrementally expanded as needs arise in the data center for capacity or bandwidth.


Objective of this project is to develop the topology helper for Jellyfish in ns3.
